# Arrays - a toolbox
A package that provides a multitude of tools to traverse, sort and modify arrays in your daily routine.
It can create arrays based of multiple input types like XML, string lists or objects. The package also provides a 
powerful solution to get entries from an array using a path definition. Say goodbye to "isset" and "array_key_exists".
