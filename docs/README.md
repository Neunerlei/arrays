# Arrays - a toolbox
A package that provides a multitude of tools to traverse, sort and modify arrays in your daily routine.
It can create arrays based of multiple input types like XML, string lists or objects. The package also provides a 
powerful solution to get entries from an array using a path definition. Say goodbye to "isset" and "array_key_exists".

## Installation
Install this package using composer:

```
composer require neunerlei/arrays
```

## Source Code
The source code can be found on github.

## Special Thanks
Special thanks goes to the folks at [LABOR.digital](https://labor.digital/) (which is the word german for laboratory and not the english "work" :D) for making it possible to publish my code online.

## Postcardware
You're free to use this package, but if it makes it to your production environment I highly appreciate you sending me a postcard from your hometown, mentioning which of our package(s) you are using.
